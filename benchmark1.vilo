(benchmark1 will ask user how many values they want to add,
then the program will add the values as they are entered and return the total sum)

|Wipeout
  <Say "Enter how many values would you like to enter: "
  >Listen R1
begin, ËœLoad R1
  ?SkipCond 400
  $Jump end
  >Listen sum
  +Add total sum
  -Sub 1 R1 (This number will decrease every time the user enters a value)
  @Loop begin
end, <Say total
  !Stop
