(benchmark1 will ask user how many values they want to add,
then the program will add the values as they are entered and return the total sum)

|Wipeout
  >Listen R1 (How many times to iterate)  010110 00000011
  Kyklo  Begin R1                        010111 (change to ascii val) 00000011
  @Loop begin R2
->begin  &Sum
  <Say R3
  !Stop
